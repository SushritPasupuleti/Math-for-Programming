# Math for Programming

Improving my math skills with python. Following the book: Math for Programmers

> “What if we learned about fine wine in school like we learn math? I don’t think I’d like wine at all if I got lectured on grape varietals and fermentation techniques for an hour a day.  Maybe in such a world, I’d need to consume three or four glasses for homework, as assigned by the teacher.  Sometimes this would be a delicious and educational experience, but sometimes I wouldn’t feel like getting loaded on a school night.  My experience in math class went something like this, and it turned me off of the subject for a while.  Like wine, mathematics is an acquired taste, and a daily grind of lectures and assignments is no way to refine one’s palate.”
